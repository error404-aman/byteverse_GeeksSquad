Introduction
Virtual Judge is a platform designed to streamline the process of analyzing legal cases and determining penalties associated with them. It allows users to submit their code solutions to programming problems, which are then tested against various test cases to determine the appropriate penalty in the culprit's case.

Problems Solved
Virtual Judge addresses several critical issues in the legal system:

1. Case Analysis: It efficiently determines the type of article involved in a case and calculates the penalty accordingly. For instance, in cases of serious crimes like rape or murder, it accurately assesses the length of imprisonment required.

2. Decision Making: Virtual Judge facilitates swift and efficient decision-making by eliminating the need for manual research. Instead of judges referring to books to determine the appropriate penalty, Virtual Judge provides instant results, saving time and resources.

3. Educational Resource: Beyond its application in legal proceedings, Virtual Judge serves as an educational tool. Students and aspiring professionals can access the platform to learn about different types of crimes and their corresponding punishments, enhancing their understanding of the legal system.

Technology Stack
Virtual Judge is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: Utilized for creating the basic structure of the website.
- CSS: Employed to enhance the visual appeal of the website and make it more user-friendly.
- JavaScript: Powers the decision-making process by evaluating user inputs and generating relevant outcomes based on predefined conditions.

Usage
To use Virtual Judge, users simply need to visit the website and provide their name along with details of the case they are interested in. The platform then processes this information and delivers the necessary analysis, including the type of article involved and the corresponding penalty.
